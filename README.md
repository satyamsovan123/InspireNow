# This app inspires you by showing random quotes.

This app has 5 quotes in an array. User cannot update the array through UI. I know, this is wierd. It is a basic app, that tries to do few things!
This app initially shows a random quote from the quotes array. If users taps on the show button, there is a segue to a different view controller, which displays list of famous people. When users tap on the names of the famous persons, there is a segue back to the original view, which shows a quote from the person they selected. This app also provides two sets of icon to choose from.
